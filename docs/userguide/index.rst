Usage
=====

The `ontolutils` package provides two sub-packages: `classes` and `namespacelib`.
The `classes` sub-package provides an object-oriented solution for working with ontologies.
The `namespacelib` sub-package provides a simple way to work with IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifiers),
which are needed to identify entities in ontologies.
